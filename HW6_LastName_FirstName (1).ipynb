    "This assignment is due on Canvas by **6:00PM on Friday October 7**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "**NOTES**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Any relevant data sets should be available in the Homework 01 assignment write-up on Canvas. To make life easier on the grader if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do $\\color{red}{\\text{Kernel}}$ $\\color{red}\\rightarrow$ $\\color{red}{\\text{Restart & Run All}}$ as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** $\\color{red}{\\text{write a summary of the results}}$ in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",
